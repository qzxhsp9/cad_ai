Module,Recommended tech,Rationale
Programming language,"TypeScript + Rust","TS for UI and app logic; Rust for geometry core compiled to Wasm for near-native speed"
Rendering engine,"WebGPU (preferred) / Three.js (WebGL2)","WebGPU compute shaders enable large-scale CAD compute; Three.js is a compatibility fallback"
Geometry kernel,"OpenCascade (Wasm) or in-house Rust kernel","CAD needs B-Rep and robust boolean ops, not just mesh"
State management,"Zustand + Immer","Lightweight, high-performance updates for high-frequency state"
Multithreading,"Web Workers + SharedArrayBuffer","Move heavy compute and parsing off main thread; zero-copy sharing"
AI interface,"ONNX Runtime Web / WebSocket","On-device lightweight inference; heavy generation via Python backend"
