Area,Technique,Description,Notes
Rendering,Instancing,"Store one geometry in GPU memory and draw many instances","Reduce draw calls"
Rendering,LOD,"Reduce mesh complexity for distant objects","Dynamic based on zoom"
Rendering,On-demand rendering,"Render only on scene or camera change","Avoid continuous rAF loop"
Rendering,Frustum culling,"Skip objects outside camera frustum","CPU-side visibility"
Rendering,Partial buffer updates,"Update only changed ranges","Avoid full buffer re-upload"
Interaction,Spatial indexing,"BVH tree for O(log n) picking","Supports million primitives"
Interaction,GPU picking,"Render unique color IDs to offscreen buffer","Read pixel to identify object"
Memory/Compute,SharedArrayBuffer,"Share memory between main thread and workers","Zero-copy data transfer"
Memory/Compute,Wasm SIMD,"Enable SIMD for vector and matrix math","Accelerate math ops"
