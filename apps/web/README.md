## Web application skeleton
This directory will host the React-based UI shell and renderer integration.

Planned structure:
- `src/` for TypeScript sources
  - `src/core/` scene graph and command data model
  - `src/renderer/` rendering integration
  - `src/state/` state management and command stack
  - `src/workers/` worker entry points
- `public/` for static assets
